25th May 2024:
Official release of the Jeanouflage website under the name: jeanouflage.github.io/jeanoufla.ge . The website looks like a website from the 2000s, but it does the job for now, so I still like it.

26th of May 2024:
Created this ChangeLog.txt file to list stuff I do on the website.
The website has been moved from jeanouflage.github.io/jeanoufla.ge to jeanouflage.github.io as it looks cleaner.
